                "Skłodowska-Curie continued her research even after her husband’s tragic death (1906). In 1910, it
                resulted in obtaining radium not as a chloride, but simply metal. A year later, for the isolation of
                pure radium and obtaining it in the crystal form, Maria was awarded the second Nobel Prize, this time in
                chemistry."
